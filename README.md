- Arranged data treatment to easy cleaned and sequences of words
- Random Forest â€“ Boosted + Grid Searching / XGBoost
- Multilayer Perceptrons
- SVM
- Sentence transformers (BERT multilingual) vs. tokens dataframe // are quite good
- Try if dimensionality reduction could improve performances // not good at all!

[IN PROGRESS]


[TODO]

- NN : check RNN
- Hard vs. Soft Voting Classifiers
- Check multilinguality of my transformer model and how could I improve that
